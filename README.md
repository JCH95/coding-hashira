# Work Day Scheduler
This repo contains code for a daily work scheduler. On the page, one will find a set time interval from 9am-5pm, with separate text blocks for each hour. These blocks are where the user can write notes to save as an agenda for the current day. At the top the current date and time are displayed. Each time block is color coded to represent the current hour (in red), the past hours (in grey), and the future hours (in green).
